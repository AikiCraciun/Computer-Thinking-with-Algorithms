# Computer Thinking with Alghorithms
## Sorting Algorithms 

This module represents my personal imprementation of the following sorting alghoritms: 
* Count Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Selection Sort

## Intructions how to run the program
1. The __repository__ directory should be downloaded locally. 
1. From the __bin__ directory, run the following command line instruction.
```
java -jar sorting.jar
```


## _Main Program Features_
The program does the following:
* It creates in a table format a summary of time spent for each sorting alghorithm to sort an array of different size. 
* The intent of the program is to analyze the benchmark of each sorting algorithm in terms of time complexity.  

Report - CTA Project.pdf represents a step by step personal report of sorting alghorithms running processes with diagrams and explanations.
